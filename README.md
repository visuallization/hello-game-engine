# hello game engine

This is my playground for learning game engine development. It is based on ["The Chernos: Game Engine Series"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxIZbV_XjAs&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT&index=1).

## Setup
Execute the `GenerateProjects.bat`. This will setup the project for you.
Once this is done, you should be able to run & debug the project in visual studio.
